The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored.

Although, an unusual feature I discovered is that there are a small amount of inspections that received a score of about 92. There are also some gaps in the data once we reach a score of 90, it appears that if a restaurant scored between 90 and 100, they received a 95, 97, or 100.\n",

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",
